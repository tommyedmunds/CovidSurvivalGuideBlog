# CovidSurvivalGuideBlog
A mostly static website that gives advice for college-aged-adults on how to navigate the world during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The majority of the site is coded in vanilla CSS/HTML. The vaccine page provides the user with a form to determine eligibility for a vaccine. If the user selects 'yes' to any of the fields, the page injects HTML containing a Google Maps iframe that provides the user with vaccination sites in Nashville, Tennessee. 

Live Demo of the Site: https://thirsty-golick-db9350.netlify.app/
