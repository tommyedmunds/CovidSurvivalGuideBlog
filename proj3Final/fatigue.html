              For millions of Americans, a rough year and endless stream of bad
              news has taken a toll in one way or another. Experts are
              increasingly seeing cases of "Covid Fatigue", where workers, both
              blue-collar and white-collar, are burning out.

              As the year has progressed, working from home has left many people
              unable to separate work from their home lives. People who work in

              families.

              Understanding pandemic fatigue is challenging because it is not
              one phenomenon and likely stems from several causes. Some of these
              include political and social trends, such as changes in
              libertarian attitudes or diminishing trust in scientific
              authorities. However, pandemic fatigue also occurs for people who
              are ostensibly on board with societal attempts to control spread
              of the virus. So, why would compliance with public health advice
              decline in these people? Despite its name, pandemic fatigue in
              these cases is not really about exhaustion or tiredness or
              depleting a mental resource. Rather, pandemic fatigue should be
              understood in terms of motivation for the tasks we choose to do.
              As such, lessons from the psychology and neuroscience of cognitive
              control may be informative.

            What can be done? It follows from this analysis that addressing
            pandemic fatigue requires a robust and multipronged response that
            addresses not only the political and social aspects, but also
            motivation in terms of costs and benefits of mitigation behaviors.
            One target is the opportunity cost. While we are social distancing
            or sheltering in place or homeschooling our children, we are not
            doing other valuable things. Many people are unable to work
            remotely, businesses are slowed or closed, and we are separated from
            loved ones. Thus, left on its own, the value in complying over time,
            discounted by its mental effort, is increasingly outweighed by the
            value in not doing so.
